# go-windows
`go-windows` is a Win32 API [language projection](https://github.com/microsoft/win32metadata/blob/master/docs/projections.md) for Go.

This project is currently a work in progress. Currently, we are parsing WinMD files out and generating code for enumerations across the Win32 API. The API is completely unstable at this point.
