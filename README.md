# go-windows
`go-windows` is a Win32 API [language projection](https://github.com/microsoft/win32metadata/blob/master/docs/projections.md) for Go.

This project is currently a work in progress. Currently, we are able to parse the raw data out of the WinMD file from the win32metadata project in Go. The next step is to further interpret and generate code based off of this metadata.
